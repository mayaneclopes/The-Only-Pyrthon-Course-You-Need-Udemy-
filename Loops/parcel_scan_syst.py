# You are automating a parcel scanning system in a warehouse. Each parcel has a barcode. The system must validate all parcels and report issues:
# Tasks:
# There is list named parcel_code which consist of barcods.
# The system will go through each barcode in the list using a for loop:
# If a barcode is "DAMAGED", skip it using continue and log: "Skipped damaged parcel".
# If a barcode is "STOP", use break and log: "Critical error: Stopping scan".
# For valid barcodes, log: "Scanned parcel: <barcode>".
# If the loop completes without hitting a break, log: "All parcels scanned successfully" using for-else.
# Return a list of all scan messages.

def scan_parcels(parcel_codes: list[str]) -> list[str]:
    logs = []
    for code in parcel_codes:
        if code == "DAMAGED":
            logs.append("Skipped damaged parcel")
            continue
        if code == "STOP":
            logs.append("Critical error: Stopping scan")
            break
        logs.append(f"Scanned parcel: {code}")
    else:
        logs.append("All parcels scanned successfully")
    return logs
