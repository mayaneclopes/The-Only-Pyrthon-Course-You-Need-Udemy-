# Imagine you’re building a backend feature for an ATM. Customers can request multiple withdrawals during one session. Your task is to simulate how the system should handle each request based on the account balance.
# Tasks:
# Use a while loop to iterate through the list named withdrawals.
# For every withdrawal:
# If the current balance is enough:
# Subtract the amount.
# Append a success message: "Withdrawn: {amount}"
# If not enough:
# Append a message: "Insufficient funds for requested amount: {amount}"
# After all withdrawals:
# Append the final balance as: "Remaining Balance: balance"
# Return a list containing all the messages.

def simulate_atm_withdrawals(balance: int, withdrawals: list[int]) -> list[str]:
    result = []
    index = 0
    while index < len(withdrawals):
        amount = withdrawals[index]
        if amount <= balance:
            balance -= amount
            result.append(f"Withdrawn: {amount}")
        else:
            result.append(f"Insufficient funds for requested amount: {amount}")
        index += 1
    result.append(f"Remaining Balance: {balance}")
